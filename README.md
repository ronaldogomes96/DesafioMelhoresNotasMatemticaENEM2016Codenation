# Predict math notes of ENEM 2016

This repository was made for the challenge proposed by [Codenation](https://www.codenation.dev) to enter AceleraDev Data Science.

The challenge context revolves around the results of ENEM 2016 (available in the file train.csv).

The model is fed by the test.csv file that predicts the math test score (column NU_NOTA_MT) of those who participated in ENEM 2016.

The answer is saved in a file called answer.csv with two columns: NU_INSCRICAO and NU_NOTA_MT.

## Topics

In this challenge, were used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Regression

## How to use?
### Python File

To use this model it is necessary to install some libraries, which can be used when downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
